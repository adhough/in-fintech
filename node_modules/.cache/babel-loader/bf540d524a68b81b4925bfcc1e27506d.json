Their actions severely damaged their clients, their organisations, financial markets and society.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nAt Wirecard, the highly opaque and international business structure, made it difficult for regulators, auditors and the media (despite brave reporting from the ‘Financial Times’) to understand the business model of the company.  Behind this complexity, a range of illegal actions took place, such as inflating reported earnings and cash flow, which led to the firm’s insolvency this year.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n<b>Values and Ethics</b>\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nDue to the leverage and complexity of their products, markets and technology, Fintech firms are exposed to similar risks of scandals as banks.  Fintech firms need to take steps to prevent financial scandals in the future.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nStart-ups have an advantage over established companies because they can embed values and ethics from the outset.  The values of a Fintech, whether a start-up or more established firm, are its unique set of beliefs and ideals, reflecting what is important to that particular firm.  Ethics is a guideline of conduct that is common across firms and society.  While values must be clear, actionable and relatable to day-to-day activities and provide a foundation for the culture and decision-making of a company, ethics set out a commitment to high standards. Both values and ethics must be implemented, monitored and governed to have a positive impact.  Ethics need to focus on protecting the interests of stakeholders such as employees, customers and society and they need to be deeply imbedded in the culture of the company so that everyone is thinking, “is this right” rather than just “is this legal”.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nLegal and regulatory guidance lags well behind the technical innovation and organisational practices in Fintech. Start-ups should establish Ethics and Governance committees with diverse views, perspectives and a range of both technical and non-technical backgrounds. These Committees need to focus on protecting the interests of stakeholders and their findings should be communicated across the firm.  Setting up an Ethics and Governance Committee is a challenge for early-stage start-ups, but even a small committee can review outcomes and provide guidance.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nHow governments and consumers view the Fintech industry over the coming years will depend on the impact of its technology and the trust it can build in society. To achieve this, a body of case studies, standards, precedents and a shared knowledge base needs to be developed. Fintech firms need to collaborate and share their experiences with ethical issues and regulators and industry associations need to provide support to build an industry-wide ethics knowledge base.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nThe culture of companies is set from the top. Leaders need to be careful about the intention of their actions and also how their actions will be interpreted. They must highlight positive examples to reinforce the correct things people are doing in the firm and embed values and ethics in interviews and performance evaluations.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nFor anyone working in Fintech, high uncertainty, stressful workplaces, long working hours, temptations and rationalisations can lead to unethical behaviour.  As per the article, ‘Building an Ethical Career’ (HBR), developing ‘if-then’ planning an help when difficult situations arise[3]. Contemplating decisions, keeping a perspective and reflecting on decisions can help to improve everyone’s decision-making process.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nI am confident that the Fintech industry can positively impact lives and develop a reputation as an ethical industry.  To create long-term sustainable value, there is no trade-off between acting ethically and successfully scaling Fintech start-ups. Let’s start by making values and ethics a priority and debate how Wirecard-like scandals can be prevented from happening.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n[1] McCrum, D and Storbeck, O (2020), ‘Wirecard says €1.9bn of cash is missing’, Financial Times, 18th June 2020, Available at: https://www.ft.com/content/1e753e2b-f576-4f32-aa19-d240be26e773, (Accessed: August 2020)\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n[2] Storbeck et al.
